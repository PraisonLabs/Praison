PraisonAI agents can be easily deployed as RESTful APIs, allowing you to integrate them into various applications and services. This guide covers how to deploy both single and multiple agents as APIs.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install Dependencies">
        Make sure you have the required packages installed:
        ```bash
        pip install "praisonaiagents[api]"
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set API Key">
        ```bash
        export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Deploy a Simple Agent API">
        Create a file named `simple-api.py` with the following code:
        ```python
        from praisonaiagents import Agent

        agent = Agent(instructions="""You are a helpful assistant.""", llm="gpt-4o-mini")
        agent.launch(path="/ask", port=3030)
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run the API Server">
        ```bash
        python simple-api.py
        ```
        
        Your API will be available at `http://localhost:3030/ask`
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Making API Requests

Once your agent is deployed, you can make POST requests to interact with it:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3030/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What is artificial intelligence?"}'
```

The response will be in JSON format:

```json
{
  "response": "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It encompasses various technologies including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. AI systems can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions."
}
```

## Multi-Agent API Deployment

You can deploy multiple agents on the same server, each with its own endpoint:

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent

weather_agent = Agent(
    instructions="""You are a weather agent that can provide weather information for a given city.""",
    llm="gpt-4o-mini"
)

stock_agent = Agent(
    instructions="""You are a stock market agent that can provide information about stock prices and market trends.""",
    llm="gpt-4o-mini"
)

travel_agent = Agent(
    instructions="""You are a travel agent that can provide recommendations for destinations, hotels, and activities.""",
    llm="gpt-4o-mini"
)

weather_agent.launch(path="/weather", port=3030)
stock_agent.launch(path="/stock", port=3030)
travel_agent.launch(path="/travel", port=3030) 
```

With this setup, you can access:
- Weather agent at `http://localhost:3030/weather`
- Stock agent at `http://localhost:3030/stock`
- Travel agent at `http://localhost:3030/travel`

## Production Deployment Options

For production environments, consider the following deployment options:

### Docker Deployment

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a Dockerfile">
        ```dockerfile
        FROM python:3.11-slim

        WORKDIR /app

        COPY requirements.txt .
        RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

        COPY . .

        EXPOSE 3030

        CMD ["python", "api.py"]
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create requirements.txt">
        ```
        praisonaiagents[api]>=0.0.79
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Build and Run Docker Container">
        ```bash
        docker build -t praisonai-api .
        docker run -p 3030:3030 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key praisonai-api
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Cloud Deployment

#### Deploying to AWS

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create an EC2 Instance">
        Launch an EC2 instance with Ubuntu or Amazon Linux.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install Dependencies">
        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install -y python3-pip
        pip install "praisonaiagents[api]"
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure Security Group">
        Make sure to open port 3030 in your security group settings.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run with Systemd">
        Create a systemd service file for automatic startup and management.
    </Step>
</Steps>

#### Deploying to Google Cloud Run

<Steps>
    <Step title="Build Docker Image">
        ```bash
        docker build -t gcr.io/your-project/praisonai-api .
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Push to Container Registry">
        ```bash
        docker push gcr.io/your-project/praisonai-api
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Deploy to Cloud Run">
        ```bash
        gcloud run deploy praisonai-api \
          --image gcr.io/your-project/praisonai-api \
          --platform managed \
          --allow-unauthenticated \
          --set-env-vars="OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key"
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## API Configuration Options

When launching your agent as an API, you can customize various parameters:

```python
agent.launch(
    path="/custom-endpoint",  # API endpoint path
    port=8080,                # Port number
    host="0.0.0.0",           # Host address (0.0.0.0 for external access)
    debug=True,               # Enable debug mode
    cors_origins=["*"],       # CORS configuration
    api_key="your-api-key"    # Optional API key for authentication
)
```

## Securing Your API

For production deployments, consider implementing:

1. **API Key Authentication**: Require API keys for all requests
2. **Rate Limiting**: Limit the number of requests per client
3. **HTTPS**: Use SSL/TLS certificates for encrypted communication
4. **Input Validation**: Validate all input data before processing

## Monitoring and Scaling

For production environments, consider:

1. **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple instances
2. **Auto-Scaling**: Automatically adjust resources based on demand
3. **Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging for debugging
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for errors and performance issues
