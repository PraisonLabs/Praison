## Getting Started

To use the Realtime Voice Interface, follow these steps:

1. Install PraisonAI with the realtime dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install "praisonai[realtime]"
   ```

2. Set up your OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```
   
   <Accordion title="Azure OpenAI Configuration">
   To use Azure OpenAI instead of standard OpenAI, configure these environment variables:
   
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-azure-api-key"
   export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/your-deployment-name"
   export OPENAI_MODEL_NAME="gpt-4o-realtime-preview"
   ```
   
   The realtime interface will automatically detect the base URL and adjust the WebSocket connection accordingly.
   </Accordion>

3. Launch the Realtime Voice Interface:
   ```bash
   praisonai realtime
   ```
