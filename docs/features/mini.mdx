<Note>
  **Prerequisites**
  - Python 3.10 or higher
  - PraisonAI Agents package installed
  - Basic understanding of Python
</Note>

## Quick Start

Create multiple AI agents that can work together in just a few lines of code!

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Package">
    First, install the PraisonAI Agents package:
    ```bash
    pip install praisonaiagents
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Import Required Components">
    Import the necessary components:
    ```python
    from praisonaiagents import Agent, Agents
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Your Agents">
    Create specialized agents with specific roles:
    ```python 
    summarise_agent = Agent(instructions="Summarise what is Photosynthesis")
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Your Agents">
    Initialize and run your agents:
    ```python
    agents = Agents(agents=[summarise_agent])
    agents.start()
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Mini AI Agents

<Card title="What are Mini AI Agents?" icon="question">
  Mini AI Agents are simplified yet powerful AI agents that can:
  - Work together to accomplish tasks
  - Use tools like internet search
  - Process and summarize information
  - Execute tasks sequentially

## Available Tools

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Internet Search" icon="search">
    ```python
    Tools.internet_search
    ```
    Search the internet using DuckDuckGo
    <Note>
      Requires: `pip install duckduckgo_search`

## Examples

### Basic Research and Summary

```terminal
pip install praisonaiagents duckduckgo_search
```

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, Agents, Tools

# Create a research agent
research_agent = Agent(
    instructions="You are a research agent to search internet about AI 2024",
    tools=[Tools.internet_search]
)

# Create a summarize agent
summarise_agent = Agent(
    instructions="You are a summarize agent to summarise research agent's findings"
)

# Initialize and run agents
agents = Agents(agents=[research_agent, summarise_agent])
agents.start()
```

### Custom Instructions

<CodeGroup>
```python Basic
# Simple instructions
research_agent = Agent(
    instructions="Research about climate change"
)
```

```python Advanced
# Detailed instructions
research_agent = Agent(
    instructions="""
    You are a research agent focused on gathering information about:
    1. Latest AI developments in 2024
    2. Major breakthroughs in machine learning
    3. New AI applications in industry
    
    Provide detailed and accurate information from reliable sources.
    """
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent Instructions">
    Write clear and specific instructions:
    ```python
    # Good
    Agent(instructions="Research and analyze the latest AI developments in 2024")
    
    # Too vague
    Agent(instructions="Research AI")
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tool Usage">
    Provide tools only to agents that need them:
    ```python
    # Research agent needs search
    research_agent = Agent(
        instructions="Research AI",
        tools=[Tools.internet_search]
    )
    
    # Summary agent doesn't need search
    summary_agent = Agent(
        instructions="Summarize findings"
    )
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Patterns

### Research and Analysis
```python
# Research agent
researcher = Agent(
    instructions="Research latest developments in quantum computing",
    tools=[Tools.internet_search]
)

# Analysis agent
analyst = Agent(
    instructions="Analyze and explain the research findings in simple terms"
)

agents = Agents(agents=[researcher, analyst])
```

### Information Processing
```python
# Data collector
collector = Agent(
    instructions="Collect information about renewable energy",
    tools=[Tools.internet_search]
)

# Summarizer
summarizer = Agent(
    instructions="Create a concise summary of the collected information"
)

# Report writer
writer = Agent(
    instructions="Write a detailed report based on the summary"
)

agents = Agents(agents=[collector, summarizer, writer])
```

## Troubleshooting
