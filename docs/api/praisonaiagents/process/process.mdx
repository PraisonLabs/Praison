# Module praisonaiagents.process.process

## Classes

### Process
The main class for handling task execution processes in different modes (sequential, hierarchical, workflow).

#### Parameters
- `tasks: Dict[str, Task]` - Dictionary of tasks to be executed
- `agents: List[Agent]` - List of available agents
- `manager_llm: Optional[str] = None` - Language model for manager agent in hierarchical process
- `verbose: bool = False` - Enable verbose logging

#### Methods
- `workflow(self)` - Execute tasks in a workflow pattern with support for loops and conditions
- `sequential(self)` - Execute tasks in sequential order
- `hierarchical(self)` - Execute tasks in hierarchical order with a manager agent

### LoopItems
A Pydantic model for handling loop data in workflow process.

#### Parameters
- `items: List[Any]` - List of items to be processed in a loop

## Process Types

### Sequential Process
- Tasks are executed one after another in a linear fashion
- Each task is completed before moving to the next one
- Simplest form of task execution

### Hierarchical Process
- Uses a manager agent to coordinate task execution
- Manager decides task order and agent assignments
- Provides more complex task orchestration
- Requires manager_llm parameter
- Supports dynamic agent assignment

### Workflow Process
- Supports complex task relationships
- Features:
  - Task dependencies
  - Conditional execution
  - Loops
  - Context sharing between tasks
- Maintains task state and relationships
- Handles data flow between tasks
