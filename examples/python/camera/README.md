# Camera Integration Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating how to integrate camera feeds with PraisonAI multimodal agents for real-time visual analysis.

## üìã Overview

PraisonAI supports visual input through the `images` parameter in Tasks. While there's no built-in camera capture, you can integrate camera feeds by capturing frames/videos and passing them to vision agents.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Requirements
```bash
pip install praisonaiagents opencv-python
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## üìÅ Examples

### 1. `camera-basic.py` - Basic Camera Capture
- **Purpose**: Capture a single frame and analyze it
- **Use Case**: Quick analysis, testing camera setup
- **Features**:
  - Single frame capture
  - Basic object and scene analysis
  - Automatic cleanup

**Usage:**
```bash
python camera-basic.py
```

### 2. `camera-continuous.py` - Continuous Monitoring
- **Purpose**: Continuous camera monitoring with periodic analysis
- **Use Case**: Security monitoring, surveillance systems
- **Features**:
  - Configurable analysis intervals
  - Real-time monitoring
  - Security-focused analysis
  - Graceful shutdown with Ctrl+C

**Usage:**
```bash
python camera-continuous.py
```

### 3. `camera-multi-agent.py` - Multi-Agent Analysis
- **Purpose**: Multiple specialized agents analyzing the same camera feed
- **Use Case**: Comprehensive analysis from different perspectives
- **Features**:
  - Security analysis agent
  - Object detection agent
  - Scene analysis agent
  - Parallel processing

**Usage:**
```bash
python camera-multi-agent.py
```

### 4. `camera-video-analysis.py` - Video Recording & Analysis
- **Purpose**: Record video segments and analyze temporal events
- **Use Case**: Activity analysis, event detection
- **Features**:
  - Video recording with configurable duration
  - Temporal event analysis
  - Timeline extraction
  - Automatic cleanup

**Usage:**
```bash
python camera-video-analysis.py
```

## üéØ Supported Input Types

- ‚úÖ **Local Images**: `"camera_shot.jpg"`, `"webcam_capture.png"`
- ‚úÖ **Local Videos**: `"security_feed.mp4"`, `"recording.avi"`
- ‚úÖ **Image URLs**: `"https://example.com/live_feed.jpg"`
- ‚úÖ **Multiple Sources**: `["cam1.jpg", "cam2.jpg", "video.mp4"]`

## üîß Configuration Options

### Camera Settings
```python
camera_id = 0  # Default camera (change to 1, 2, etc. for other cameras)
```

### Analysis Intervals
```python
analysis_interval = 10  # Seconds between analyses for continuous monitoring
```

### Recording Duration
```python
recording_duration = 15  # Seconds for video recording
```

## üí° Integration Patterns

### 1. Real-time Processing
```python
# Capture frames periodically and process them as separate tasks
def capture_and_analyze():
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if ret:
        cv2.imwrite("temp_capture.jpg", frame)
        # Process with PraisonAI agent
    cap.release()
```

### 2. Batch Analysis
```python
# Process multiple camera angles simultaneously
task = Task(
    description="Analyze multiple camera feeds",
    agent=vision_agent,
    images=["cam1.jpg", "cam2.jpg", "cam3.jpg"]
)
```

### 3. Video Analysis
```python
# Save video segments and analyze them
task = Task(
    description="Analyze this video for activities",
    agent=vision_agent,
    images=["security_footage.mp4"]  # Video files work too
)
```

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Camera Permissions**: Ensure your application has camera access
- **Privacy**: Be mindful of privacy when recording/analyzing
- **Storage**: Clean up temporary files to avoid storage issues
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls for camera systems

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Found
```python
# Check available cameras
for i in range(4):  # Check first 4 camera indices
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(i)
    if cap.isOpened():
        print(f"Camera {i} is available")
        cap.release()
```

### Permission Issues
- On Linux: Add user to `video` group
- On macOS: Grant camera permissions in System Preferences
- On Windows: Check camera privacy settings

### Performance Optimization
- Reduce frame size for faster processing
- Adjust analysis intervals based on requirements
- Use parallel processing for multiple agents
