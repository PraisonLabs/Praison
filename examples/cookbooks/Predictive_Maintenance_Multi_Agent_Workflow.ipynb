        "1. **Temperature**: At 86Â°F, the temperature is relatively warm. Depending on the context (e.g., industrial equipment, environmental monitoring), this could be within normal operating conditions or might require cooling measures if it's above the optimal range.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Pressure**: A pressure reading of 101 is often within normal ranges for many systems, but without specific units or context, it's hard to determine if this is optimal or requires adjustment.\n",
