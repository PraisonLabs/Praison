        "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science focused on developing methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.\n",

        "**Applications of AI:**\n",
        "- Advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search)\n",
        "- Recommendation systems (e.g., YouTube, Amazon, Netflix)\n",
        "- Virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa)\n",
        "- Autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo)\n",
        "- Generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT, AI art)\n",
        "- Superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess, Go)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Subfields and Techniques:**\n",
        "AI research is centered around goals such as learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and robotics support. Techniques include search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws from psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.\n",
        "\n",
        "**History and Development:**\n",
        "AI was founded as an academic discipline in 1956. The field has experienced cycles of optimism and disappointment, known as AI winters. Interest and funding increased significantly after 2012 with the use of graphics processing units to accelerate neural networks and the success of deep learning. The AI boom in the 2020s was marked by advanced generative AI, raising ethical concerns and discussions about regulatory policies.\n",

        "AGI, or human-level intelligence AI, would match or surpass human capabilities across virtually all cognitive tasks. Some researchers believe that current large language models show early signs of AGI-level capability, while others argue that genuine AGI has not yet been achieved. AGI is distinct from artificial superintelligence (ASI), which would outperform human abilities across every domain. Unlike artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), AGI can generalize knowledge, transfer skills between domains, and solve novel problems without task-specific reprogramming.\n",
        "\n",
        "Creating AGI is a major goal for companies like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Meta, aiming to develop AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task as well as a human."
