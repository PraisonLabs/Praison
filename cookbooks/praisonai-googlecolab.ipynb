            "1. **Kepler-452b**: Discovered in 2015 by NASA's Kepler mission, Kepler-452b is often referred to as Earth's \"cousin.\" It is about 1.6 times the size of Earth and orbits within the habitable zone of a G-type star similar to our Sun, located approximately 1,400 light-years away from Earth. Its potential for hosting life lies in its Earth-like characteristics, though its actual habitability remains uncertain due to its distance and lack of detailed atmospheric data.\n",

Proxima Centauri b is roughly 1.27 times the size of Earth and resides within the star's habitable zone, where liquid water could potentially exist. Its proximity makes it a prime candidate for future studies on habitability and atmospheric composition.\n",

Located about 39 light-years away, these planets are of significant interest due to their potential for liquid water. The compact nature of the system and the small, cool star around which they orbit make them excellent targets for atmospheric studies using telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope.\n",
